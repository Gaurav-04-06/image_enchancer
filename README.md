## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm installed
- PicWish API key (sign up at [PicWish](https://picwish.com) and get your API key)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gaurav-04-06/image_enchancer.git
   cd image_enchancer
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Add your PicWish API key:

   If you use environment variables, create a `.env` file in the root:

   ```ini
   VITE_APP_PICWISH_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

   Or replace the placeholder in the code directly (not recommended for security reasons).

## Notes

- For production apps, consider proxying API requests via a backend for better security.
- Check PicWish API docs for request limits and pricing.
